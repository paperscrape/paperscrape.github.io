Unspecified blinding was used. Results showed that lower achieved LDL-C levels-down to very low levels <20 mg/dL-were associated with a lower risk of the primary efficacy end point (adjusted P(trend)<0.0001 for each end points) and the key secondary efficacy end point (adjusted P(trend)<0.0001 for each end points) with no significant safety concerns.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36779348/?format=pubmed,
